        <p>In this post, I will continue with the "budget" theme we explored in "<a href="/post/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host" title="Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host" target="_blank">Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host</a>" and breakdown where and how I host my database, email services, dedicated production VM and dedicated dev shared hosting environment for Pioneer Code. Oh yeah, did I mention that I do this all for as low as <b>$7.95 a month</b>!</p>
        <h2>Production VM at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a></h2>
        <p>Prior to migrating from ASP.NET 4.6.x to ASP.NET Core 1.x, I hosted Pioneer Code on a shared hosting plan at <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a>.  When I switched over to ASP.NET Core I wanted a bit more control of my environment which lead me down the path of finding a Linux Hosted VM provider. Keeping the "budget" them in mind, I chose <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>. Their base "droplet (VM)" comes in at <b>$5.00</b> a month and can be scaled as needed.  Can't get much cheaper than that and if you're curious, their service so far has been stellar.</p>
        <p>For more information on my entire deployment process to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>, be sure to check out the first part of this post at <a href="/post/developing-a-net-core-site-in-windows-and-deploying-it-to-a-budget-linux-host" title="Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host" target="_blank">Developing A .NET Core Site In Windows and Deploying It To A Budget Linux Host</a>. </p>
        <h2>Everything Else At <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a></h2>
        <p>What about your database?  What about your email services? Well, that is where <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> steps in. Having dealt with them for over a year with no problems and comparing dollar for dollar against other Windows shared hosting companies, I found little reason not to continue using them to fill in the gaps.  Oh, and guess what?  I am doing so for <b>$3.95</b> a month.</p>
        <h3>Database</h3>
        <p>Naturally, though not necessary, Pioneer Code is backed by a SQL Server database. To be more specific, SQL Server 2016.  This left me with few options.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Host my database at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/" title="Azure SQL Server">Azure</a> for <b>$4.99</b> on their base plan and find another third-party provider for my email services.<ul>
              <li>Though <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/" title="Azure SQL Server">Azure</a> was enticing, if we are to continue down the road of "budget friendly", there are better options.  Especially when consider you will need to take on a third cost for your email services.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Find a competitor to <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> switch to them.
            <ul>
              <li>Though <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> is typically highly regarded, some would argue that another service provider might be better. From experience, I have had little to no problems with <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> over the past year or so.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Stick with what I know best, <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a>!
            <ul>
              <li>Their base plan is only <b>$3.95</b> a month!  I have yet to find anyone else who can top that.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, I am hosting my production database at <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> and accessing it through my <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> VM.</p>
        <p class="note"><a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> servers appear to be on the west coast.  Obviously, there is a desire to get your SQL Server as close to your Web Server as possible.  Luckily <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> allows you to select from a number regions to host your "droplets (VM)).  Meaning, in theory, I was able to get my database and web server "relatively" close to each other.</p>
        <h3>Development Environment & Email Services</h3>
        <p>The <b>$3.95</b> base plan <a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> offers also covers my email services.  As a bonus, I also get to use the shared hosting service include for whatever I want.  Currently, I am using it as a development deployment for various projects, but there is nothing to stop me from using it for another small production deployment.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Let's do a small recap.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=d95b905a1279" title="DigitalOcean" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> at <b>$5.00</b> a month.
            <ul>
              <li>Linux VM that is scalable as needed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><a href="http://www.winhost.com/a/chadr" title="WinHost" target="_blank">WinHost</a> at <b>$3.95</b> a month.
            <ul>
              <li>Production Database</li>
              <li>Email Services</li>
              <li>Additional shared hosting deployment</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All that for <b>$7.95</b> a month! If that is not "budget friendly", I don't know what is.</p>
        <p class="note">My goals when choosing my deployment stack where simple, do it for as cheap as I can while maintaining a decent level of quality. Of which I think accomplished.  That being said, I am not delusional. If Pioneer Code starts gaining significant traffic, my deployment stack might have to be adjusted to suit those needs.  Until then, I am perfectly happy with where I am at.</p>
