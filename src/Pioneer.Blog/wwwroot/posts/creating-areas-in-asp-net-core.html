        <p>Structuring maintainable projects is key when it comes to the long-term success of any project. One feature in <a href="https://www.asp.net/mvc" title="ASP.NET MVC" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 4.6.x</a> that I utilized often to aid in the process is the idea of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas" target="_blank" title="ASP.NET MVC Core Areas">Areas</a>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas" target="_blank" title="ASP.NET MVC Core Areas">Areas</a> are used to organize independent parts of the project into maintainable and familiar folder structures. I like to think of them as nested-projects or sub-projects inside your main project. Each nested project (Area) has it's own folder structure (controllers, views, etc..) and by default is sandboxed by adding an additional route segment to access pages inside these Areas.</p>
        <p>Lucky for us, the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/" title="ASP.NET MVC Core" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC Core</a> team followed suit and provided us with the same functionality.</p>
        <h2>Creating an Area</h2>
        <p>A classic example of where to use Areas is that of an Admin Area. Administrative operations are a logic separation from the public section of your site and by way of, we should do our best to keep code specific to those operations from dirtying up our public code.</p>
        <h3>1: Create your Area folder structure</h3>
        <p>Area folders need to follow a convention.  In you project root, you need a folder called <b>Areas</b>.  In this folder, you will then have one corresponding folder for each of your Areas. So in our admin example, we would have something like this.</p>
        <a href="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-folder.png" title="Admin Area Folder" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-folder.png" alt="Admin Area Folder" style="max-width: 180px;" />
        </a>
        <p>The <b>Areas/Admin</b> folder now can be treated like its own independent project inside our main project.</p>
        <h3>2: Setting up a Controller</h3>
        <p>Just like in our main project, we will need to create a <b>Controllers</b> folder.</p>
        <a href="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-controller-folder.png" title="Admin Area Controller Folder" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-controller-folder.png" alt="Admin Area Controller Folder" style="max-width: 180px;" />
        </a>
        <p>Inside the <b>Controllers</b> folder, we can create our first Admin Area controller.</p>
        <a href="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-controller-class.png" title="Admin Area Controller Class" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-controller-class.png" alt="Admin Area Controller Class" style="max-width: 180px;" />
        </a>
        <p>These classes share the exact same syntax as a regular controller except for one minor difference.  You need to decorate your class with an <b>Area Attribute</b> to say that this class belongs to this area.</p>
        <pre class="brush: csharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace Pioneer.Blog.Areas.Admin.Controllers
{
    [Area("Admin")]
    public class UsersController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}</pre>
        <h3>3: Setting up a View</h3>
        <p>Just like our root project, we will need a <b>Views</b> folder.  And inside that <b>Views</b> folder, we will need a folder named the same as our Controller class and a View named after our controller function.</p>
        <a href="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-view.png" title="Admin Area Controller View" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/creating-areas-in-asp-net-core/admin-area-view.png" alt="Admin Area Controller View" style="max-width: 180px;" />
        </a>
        <h3>4: Wiring up our Routing</h3>
        <p>The last step requires us to tell our Router that we are using Areas.  In your <b>Startup.cs</b> class, add the following to your Router configuration.</p>
        <pre class="brush: csharp">app.UseMvc(routes =>
{
  // Areas support
  routes.MapRoute(
    name: "areaRoute",
    template: "{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
  // Removed for abbreviation....
</pre>
        <p>Now that the route knows we are using Areas, based on our naming convention we should be able to access our new admin user page with the following route.</p>
        <pre>http://your-site.com/admin/users</pre>
        <p>As noted at the beginning of this post, our Area is sandboxed by adding the name of the Area before the controller.</p>
        <p>That is it!  Pretty straight forward but super powerful.  Once you get cooking with the concept, you will start to notice the many benefits it offers.  I particularly like the idea of abstracting Area specific markup out of my main <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/layout" title="Layout File" target="_blank"><b>Layout.cshtml</b></a> file and putting it into nested Layout files that are specific to an Area but share our main Layout throughout the project.</p>
