        <p class="note">Being this blog post was created using a VS 2017 RC, things are bound to change over time.  I will do my best to keep this post up-to-date as we get closer to a GA/RTM release of VS 2017.</p>
        <p>
          March 7th, 2017 is just around the corner and with it comes the general availability of <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio 2017" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2017</a>. Those who have been exploring the RC builds might have noticed a slew of updates coming to the <b>dotnet new</b> command in the dotnet command line. One such feature now allows us to create project templates that can be installed from a <a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/chad_ramos" title="NuGet" target="_blank">NuGet</a> package or local folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will use the <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-console-boilerplate" title="Pioneer Console Boilerplate" target="_blank">Pioneer Console Boilerplate</a> project I created to demonstrate the concepts of <a href="" title="Dependency Injection, Logging, and Configuration In A .NET Core Console Application" target="_blankd">"Dependency Injection, Logging and Configuration In A .NET Core Console Application</a>" to show the following.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#migarting">Migrating <b>project.json</b> to the new <b>.csproj</b> build config required in VS 2017.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#create">Create necessary config to allow your project to serve as a template.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#install">Installing your template from a local folder.</a></li>
          <li><a href="#remove">Removing your template.</li>
          <li><a href="#publish">Publishing and installing from Nuget.</a></li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="migrating">Migrating project.json</h2>
        <p>
          In an effort to simplify compatibility with MSBuild, <b>project.json</b> is being retired in favor of <b>.csproj</b>. The process, in most cases, is dirt simple. You have one of two options, run <b>dotnet migrate</b> or automation provided by Visual Studio 2017. For this project, I choose to have Visual Studio guide me through the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I opened up <a href="https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-console-boilerplate" title="Pioneer Console Boilerplate" target="_blank">Pioneer Console Boilerplate</a> in VS 17, I was prompted with the following.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/migration-prompt.png" title="Migration Prompt" target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/migration-prompt.png" alt="Migration Prompt" style="max-width: 686px;" />
        </a>
        <p>
          After confirming by clicking <b>OK</b>, I was supplied with the following report.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/migration-report.png" title="Migration Report" target="_blank">

        </a>
        <p>
          Everything is pretty self-explanatory. A backup was made of all files being touched prior to migration, followed by the actual migration taking place. Below is a view of the original <b>project.json</b> and the new <b>Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate.csproj</b> files side by side for comparison.

        <h2 id="create">Adding Template Configuration</h2>
        <div class="note">
          <p>At the time a wrote this blog, details on the dotnet new templating system are understandable lacking. After all, I am doing this in an RC of VS 17. The information I was able to gather came from one of three sources.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The official <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/%22Runnable-Project%22-Templates" title="Dot Net Core templating documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</li>
            <li>
              A project that has the templating system already figure out.
              <ul>
                <li>In it I reference a build script used to generate necessary files.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices/blob/dev/templates/package-builder/src/build/build.ts" target="_blank" title="JavascriptServices GitHub">JavascriptServices</a> by <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/" target="_blank" title="Steve Standerson">Steve Standerson</a>.</li>
                <li>Going straight to the source and asking <a href="https://twitter.com/sayedihashimi" title="Sayed I. Hashimi" target="_blank">Sayed I. Hashimi</a> on twitter.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
          Let's start by creating a folder called <b>.template.config</b> in the project you want make a template. Inside that folder, add a file called <b>template.json</b>.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/template-config-view.png" title="Template Solution View" target="_blank">

        </a>
        <p>
          There is a pretty long list of configuration options that can go into your <b>template.json</b> file. For more information, I recommend going to official <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/%22Runnable-Project%22-Templates" title="Dot Net Core templating documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Below is what I have added to my configuration, mostly consisting of required fields.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: json">{
  "author": "Chad Ramos &lt;chad@pioneercode.com&gt;",
  "classifications": [ "Console", "Boilerplate", "Dependency Injection", "Logging", "Configuration" ],

  "sourceName": "Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate"
}</pre>
        <h2 id="install">Installing Your Template From a Local Folder</h2>
        <p>
          To install your project as a template from your local folder, run the following - <b>dotnet new --install C:\source\Repos\pioneer-console-boilerplate\Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate</b>. You will need to adjust the path to your project as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once installed, you should see your template in the available list. Run <b>dotnet new -l</b> to list all templates available.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-list.png" title="Dot Net new list." target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-list.png" alt="Dot Net new list." style="max-width: 1551px;" />
        </a>
        <p>
          To use your new template to generate a project, run the following command with appropriate <b>Short Name</b> and project name to output with, <b>dotnet new consoleboilerplate -n my.console</b>. You should now see your new project in the directory specified.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-project.png" title="New Project." target="_blank">

        </a>
        <h3>Where Does Your New Template Cache Live & How Do I Remove My Template From That Cache?</h3>
        <p class="note">This section only exists because I was curious. At this point, I  would not recommend manually editing these files.</p>
        <p>
          By running the <b>dotnet new -i [source]</b> command, you are telling the cli to cache a reference to your package configuration. The <b>dotnetcli</b> needs to store this information in order to display your templates information when running <b>dotnet new</b>. That being the case, I started searching around my local directories to find the file(s) holding this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Navigate to <b>C:\Users\vagrant\.templateengine\dotnetcli\v1.0.0-rc4-004771</b>. You will obviously have to update the user and version to suite your needs. In this folder there are few files, <b>templatecache.json</b>, <b>settings.json</b> & <b>en-us.templatecache.json</b>. Each of held a reference to my local template.
        </p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/template-cache.png" title="Template cache" target="_blank">

        </a>
        <p class="note">After manually deleting the references to my template from these files, <b>dotnet new -l</b> no longer had a reference to my template.</p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/empty-list.png" title="Empty List" target="_blank">

        </a>
        <h2 id="remove">Removing your template</h2>
        <p class="note">Fair warning, being I can't find documentation on the <b>reinit</b> flag I can only assume that you will lose all configuration you have done to your environment.</p>
        <p>At the moment there is no syntax to remove a single template.  It appears to be coming, though.  That being said, you can run <b>dotnet new --debug:reinit</b> to re-initialize your environment.   Of which will effectively remove any new templates you added. </p>

        <h2 id="publish">Creating A NuGet Package To Serve Our Template.</h2>
        <p>What if we want to serve up our template through a NuGet package? Lucky for us, the process is pretty straight forward.</p>
        <h3>Creating A nuspec file</h3>
        <p class="note">For a full reference of possible configuration, you can visit the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package">Creating A Package</a> documentation.  At the date of this publishing, V4.0 of <b>nuget.exe</b> was still a RC.  That being said, the <b>packageTypes</b> node was not yet documented because it is new to V4.0.</p>
        <p>We need to first create a manifest that describes our package.  This file in the NuGet world is refereed to as a <b>nuspec</b> file. That being said, let's start out by creating a file called <b>Templates.nuspec</b> place at the root of your project for the time being.</p>
        <p>I added the following to my file.</p>
        <pre class="brush: xml">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd"&gt;
    &lt;metadata&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;

        &lt;requireLicenseAcceptance&gt;true&lt;/requireLicenseAcceptance&gt;
        &lt;packageTypes&gt;
            &lt;packageType name="Template" /&gt;
        &lt;/packageTypes&gt;
    &lt;/metadata&gt;
&lt;/package&gt;></pre>
        <h3>Reorganizing Our Project</h3>
        <p>The contract that NuGet defines is for your <b>nuspec</b> file to live by a folder called content.  The content folder will house the static files that make up your template. With that in mind, I decided to nest my project code one level deeper to facilitate this.  Make note that you will have to move your <b>nuspec</b> file out of your project source folder.</p>

        </a>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/nuspec-content.png" title="Nuspec Content" target="_blank">

        </a>
        <h3>Building A Package</h3>
        <div class="note">
          <p>According to the <a href="https://dist.nuget.org/index.html" title="Nuget Distributions" target="_blank">Nuget Distributions</a> page, NuGet 4.x is included in the Visual Studio 2017 installation.  With my current VS 2017 RC install, I could not find the executable and ended up downloading it directly from the link I just provided.  </p>
          <p>Typically you would be able to reference <b>nuget</b> directly on the command line by scoping to the directory your <b>nuget.exe</b> is installed or by adding a <b>PATH</b> variable to your environment.  In my case I chose to temporary move the <b>nuget.exe</b> I downloaded to the directory my <b>nuspec</b> file lived.</p>
          <p>I trust on a fresh install of VS 17 GA/RTM, the <b>nuget.exe</b> will be available.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Now that we have our <b>nuspec</b> file created and our static content in the appropriate folder, let's go ahead and create our package by running the following command, <b>nuget pack</b>.  You should end up with a file that with the following structure, <b>[id][version].nupkg</b>.  The id and version variables come directly from your <b>nuspec</b> configuration.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>.nupkg</b> can be extracted with a zip client.  I used 7-Zip to peek into my package and verify the contents of the <b>Content</b> folder.</p>
        <h3>Publishing A Package</h3>
        <p>This is a topic that is out of the scope of this blog post. In short, I did the following.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a new account at <a href="nuget.org" title="Nuget Site" target="_blank">nuget.org</a></li>
          <li>Used the <b>Upload Package</b> dashboard to verify and upload my package.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My package was then made available at <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate/" title="Pioneer Console Boilerplate Nuget Feed" target="_blank">Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate</a>.</p>
        <p class="note">For more information on how to publish your package, head over to the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/creating-a-package">Creating A Package</a> documentation.</p>
        <h3>Consuming Your Package</h3>
        <p>Now that your package is available from the NuGet repository, you can install your template directly from your need feed.</p>
        <p>After running <b>dotnet new -i Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate::*</b>, I ended up with the following.</p>
        <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-list.png" title="Dot Net new list." target="_blank">
          <img src="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-list.png" alt="Dot Net new list." style="max-width: 1551px;" />
        </a>
        <p>In regards to the <b>Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate::*</b> portion of that command, the <b>asterisk</b> signifies "I want the latest version". I could have targeted a specific version using something like <b>Pioneer.Console.Boilerplate::0.1.0</b></p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>As of the date this was posted, the syntax for install a nuget package is as follows <b>dotnet new --install [name]::[version]</b>.  In the very near future this will change to <b>dotnet new --version [name]::[version]</b>. For more information, you can check out the open issue at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/issues/330" title="GitHub Templating" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
          <a href="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-version.png" title="Dot Net new version." target="_blank">
            <img src="/images/how-to-create-a-dot-net-new-project-template-in-dot-net-core/new-version.png" alt="Dot Net new version." style="max-width: 590px;" />
          </a>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, you can again install your template by running the following command with appropriate Short Name and project name to output with, <b>dotnet new consoleboilerplate -n my.console</b>.</p>
        <p>That is that.  Though there are still some challenges to overcome with dotnet new templating being new and all, the future looks very bright.  As always, let me know your thoughts below in the comments section.</p>
