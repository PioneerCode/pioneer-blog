<p>Being productive as a developer comes in many forms. One such form being the ability to navigate the command line just as
  proficiently as you can a full blown GUI.</p>
<p>Often I find myself at a command line gearing up to run a number of processes...</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">npm install &lt;package&gt;
bower install &lt;package&gt;
gulp
dotnet restore
vagrant up</pre>
<p>All of which have a corresponding script or config file(s) associated with it. Meaning, these commands are run more often
  than not in the same directory as the script resides. </p>
<blockquote>When a script bombs, what do you do?</blockquote>
<p>It pains me to watch a counterpart of my mind navigate to a directory, run a command, watch the command fail and open an
  editor to then again navigate to that script before opening it up in said editor. A process that usually takes over a minute.
  </p>
<p>The idea of opening files directly from a command-line is nothing new. We all should be familiar with the following.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash">notepad some-text-file.txt</pre>
<p>Luckily for those of use who have taken a liking to
  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="Visual Studio Code" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> for quick edits, the same extremely efficient command is available. Use it and use it often! </p>
<pre class="brush: bash">code . some-config-file.json</pre>
