## What is coming in the future

- If your curious what is coming down the pipe, I track features as [issues](https://github.com/PioneerCode/pioneer-blog/issues).
- If there is interest, I am willing to entertain the idea of abstracting the vast majority of code away from the Pioneer Blog domain so that it can't be reused without to much refactoring.
